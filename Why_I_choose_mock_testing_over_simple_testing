UNIT_TESTING

Unit testing focus on the single unit_test like test a single unit or method to check if it is working properly and when i will it
any parameter than is it fulfilling our expections. Are it overcome the actual output it must generate on given parameters.
By using Unit testing we can find bugs in early stage of developement and can easily fix that bug.
When we using unit testing, we can refector code with much confidence, knowing if there is any error the testing will catch it..


MOCK_TESING

In Mock_testing we can also check the methods isolating from its dependencies like APIs,database ETC.
This isolating means you can focus on the single unit working without worrying about its external factors.
Mocks enable you to simulate specific behaviors and scenarios, such as error conditions or responses from dependencies, which
might be difficult to reproduce with real objects.
Tests that rely on mocks typically run faster because they avoid the overhead of actual network calls or database interactions.
While unit tests focus on individual components, mocks help facilitate integration testing by allowing you to substitute
complex or time-consuming components with simpler mock implementations.
